# WingRep Notes

A simplified Notion-style block editor built for the WingRep take-home assessment.

**Live demo:** [wingrepassignment.vercel.app](https://wingrepassignment.vercel.app)

Data is stored per-browser in localStorage — reviewers get a fresh workspace on first visit.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # add your OpenAI API key
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Stack

- **Vite + React + TypeScript** — fast client-side SPA
- **BlockNote** — block editor (paragraph, heading, bullets, DnD, formatting)
- **Zustand + localStorage** — persistence across refresh
- **Tailwind CSS** — layout and chrome
- **OpenAI gpt-4o-mini** — selection transform engine (via Vercel serverless in production)

## What's working

**Core (spec)**
- Block-based editor with text, headings, bullet lists
- Bold and italic inline formatting
- Drag-and-drop block reorder (BlockNote built-in handles)
- Multiple pages with sidebar navigation
- Editable page title in the canvas
- Content persists to localStorage on change

**Polish**
- Collapsible sidebar (persisted preference)
- URL routing: `/p/:pageId`, `/library`, `/trash`
- Delete confirmation → soft delete to trash
- Trash with restore, delete forever, and 30-day auto-purge on app load
- Sidebar search and sort (last edited / A–Z)
- Library view — table with search, sort, and column visibility toggles
- Empty states for no pages, no search results, and empty trash
- Focus title input when creating or restoring a page
- ⌘K quick search, page ⋯ menu, trash restore toast

**AI transforms**
- Highlight text → **Transform** on the formatting toolbar
- Presets: Checklist, Project plan, Meeting notes, Email draft, Clarify
- Custom transforms (up to 20) — name + description, test preview, edit/delete
- Partial selections expand to whole block(s) before transforming
- All transforms apply immediately (⌘Z to undo); custom transforms can be tested in the editor before saving
- Hover a transform in the menu for a one-line summary

## Decisions & tradeoffs

### Architecture

| Choice | Why | What we skipped |
|--------|-----|-----------------|
| **Vite + React + TS** (not Next.js) | Fastest path to a client-only SPA; no hydration edge cases with localStorage | Server-rendered pages, built-in API routes |
| **BlockNote** (not custom editor) | Highest schedule risk removed — blocks, slash menu, DnD, and formatting work out of the box | Full control over editor internals |
| **Zustand + localStorage** | Minimal persistence layer; one source of truth, survives refresh | Backend sync, multi-device data |
| **Tailwind** | Fast layout and polish without a design-system build-out | Component library (shadcn, etc.) |

BlockNote's built-in drag handles cover DnD — no custom `@dnd-kit` layer. Flat block list for v1; BlockNote handles list indent natively.

### Product & UX

Core spec shipped first, then polish:

- **Soft-delete trash** with 30-day auto-purge — safer than hard delete, no backend needed
- **Library view** — table with search, sort, and column toggles over page metadata; not a full Notion database or filter builder (~80% value at ~20% cost)
- **URL routing** (`/p/:pageId`, `/library`, `/trash`) — shareable links and browser back/forward; added after v1 when polish time allowed
- **Collapsible sidebar**, ⌘K quick search, page ⋯ menu, trash restore toast
- **Inline canvas title** with empty placeholder (Notion-style) instead of sidebar-only editing
- **Hydration gate** — Zustand persist can race on reload; app waits for `onFinishHydration` before rendering to avoid white-screen flicker

### AI transforms

LLM as a **transform engine**, not a chat sidebar — aligned with WingRep's "AI does real work" angle:

- Highlight text → **Transform** on the formatting toolbar → structured markdown blocks replace the selection
- Five hardcoded presets + up to 20 **custom transforms** (name + description, stored in localStorage)
- Partial selections expand to whole block(s) via BlockNote's `getSelection()`
- `gpt-4o-mini` behind a Vercel serverless route (`/api/transform`) so the API key stays off the client; Vite dev middleware mirrors the same route locally
- Custom transforms can be tested in the editor modal before saving; all transforms apply immediately (⌘Z to undo)

### Intentionally skipped

Full Notion database filters, nested outline blocks, backend page sync, real-time collaboration, and a chat-based AI UI.
Given this project's reqs, the above just didn't seem necessary for a fully functioning deployable product. The main task for me in this project was the standout AI feature and show my attention to detail through other aspects of the UX. I took a lot of inspiration from Notion where it made sense but simplified things where I could because this product just doesn't have/need as much weight as Notion.

I focused on this AI feature because it seemed meaningfully different than what Notion is currently doing. Rather than having general purpose AI commands, I wanted an abstraction that was more about saving a particular way of thinking — especially directly tied to content modifications itself. Different people have different use cases and different ways of approaching them. Giving them this kind of flexibility allows them to be more structured at any point in their note-taking journey; makes the whole process more approachable.
